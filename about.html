					<h2 class="page-title">A little bit about me</h2>
					<p>I've decided to reinvent myself by learning to code.  My journey into tech started by volunteering to assist a close friend
                	with a budding music career.   As I began to gradually create content to enhance this musician's online presence, I was
                	amazed at how quickly technology can change the trajectory of one's goals.</p>
                	<p class="dark"> As time progressed, I found myself enjoying the ability to create so decided to learn how to build my own
                	website.  I'm hoping to eventually make a complete migration to front-end development, where I can use my persistence,
               		creativity, and organization to write clean, elegant code. </p>

					<h2>What I Do</h2>
					<p class="dark">I approach my projects with perseverance and sincerity.  It is important to me to approach my work with the guiding principle that "it's nice to be important, but more important to be nice."</p>
